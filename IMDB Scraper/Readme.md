# IMDB Scraper

## Problem statement:
To scrape the data from the famous movie and TV series rating site IMDB.

## Description:
The scraper is used to get details of specific movies and TV series listed on the IMDB website.

## Data description
In the process I collected data in the form of 

MOVIE NAME: name of the movie
TITLE: heading of the comment
RATING: movie rating
REVIEW DATE: date when the review was given or the date of comment
REVIEWER: name of the reviewer
WARNING: spoiler warnings 
REVIEW: the actual textual review or comment text

## [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)
IMDb is the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content. Find ratings and reviews for the newest movie and TV shows. Get personalized recommendations, and learn where to watch across hundreds of streaming providers.

## Libraries: 
* BeautifulSoup
* requests
* regex
* flask

I have attached the requirements.txt file for making it easy to use the scraper on your machine.
The scraper code is marked with annotations to understand the process in each step.

Below is the diagram explaining the process of scraping for this project.

## Future Scope:
The data can be used to create ML projects. It can also be used for an NLP project where the reviews will predict on the box-office collections.</br>

:exclamation:Disclaimer</br>
The reviews and ratings are publicly available on the said website. The credit remains to the rightful owners of the reviews and website owners as it is hosted on their website. This scraper is an attempt to show how listed libraries can be used to scrape data from websites and how an industry standard code looks like.
